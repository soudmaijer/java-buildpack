# Play Container
The Play Container allows Play applications to be run.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Detection Criteria</strong></td><td>The Play start script and the Play runtime JAR exist in the appropriate subdirectories of the application
	directory or one of its immediate subdirectories (but not in both)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Tags</strong></td><td><tt>play-framework=&lt;version&gt;</tt></td>
  </tr>
</table>
Tags are printed to standard output by the buildpack detect script

## Configuration
The Play Container cannot be configured.
